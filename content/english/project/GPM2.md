GPM Holding is currently developing two additional photovoltaic solar parks:
**GreenPower Morocco 2 and GreenPower Morocco 4.**

Like their predecessor, these projects fall under the framework of Law 13-09, which governs electricity production from
renewable sources and promotes the development of green energy projects in Morocco.
