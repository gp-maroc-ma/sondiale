GPM Holding, through its subsidiary GreenPower Morocco 1 S.A., has successfully developed a 30 MWac photovoltaic park.
The facility is located at Douar Daidaat, within the Hjar Ennhal commune of the Tangier-Asilah prefecture.

Developed within the framework of Law 13-09 regarding renewable energies, the project represents a significant
contribution to Morocco's green energy infrastructure.

- Project: GreenPower Morocco 1 (Operational)
- Location: Hjar Ennhal, Tangier-Asilah
- Capacity: 30 MWac
- Surface Area: 72 hectares
- Annual Production: Approximately 67 GWh
- Total Investment: 37 million USD

### Technology & Infrastructure

The GPM 1 solar park utilizes state-of-the-art equipment designed to guarantee clean, reliable, and high-performance
energy production.

- **Solar Tracking:** The panels are mounted on horizontal-axis solar trackers aligned in a North-South direction. This
  technology allows the panels to follow the sunlight from sunrise to sunset, maximizing energy production throughout
  the day.
- **Energy Conversion:** Photovoltaic panels capture solar energy and convert it into electricity. This output is
  optimized by inverter systems that ensure a stable and efficient transformation of the current.
- **Grid Integration:** The energy produced is transmitted via transformer stations and delivery substations, allowing
  for safe and seamless integration into the national electrical grid.

This system offers fluid, secure operation compliant with industry best practices while supplying green electricity to the network.
