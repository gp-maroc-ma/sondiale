#### Technical Director – Technology & Process Safety

Alan is a chemical engineer who has focused 36 years of his career on technology and operations for conversion of
metallurgical grade silicon to methylchlorosilanes and trichlorosilane for production of silicones, polycrystalline
silicon and silicon-based anode materials for lithium ion batteries. One specific area of expertise is the safe design
and operation of metallurgical grade silicon grinding plants. He excels in root cause identification of complex
commercial problems and implementation of improved process technology focused on reduction of operating costs. Alan has
worked as an independent chemical engineering consultant since late 2008 in the global silicone and polycrystalline
silicon industries with clients in Asia, Europe, Middle East and the United States. He formerly worked for REC Silicon (
2004-2008) and began his career with General Electric in a wide range of jobs at three GE businesses including GE
Silicones (1989 – 2004). Alan is a motivated, detail oriented engineer of high integrity who is not afraid to challenge
the status quo of existing technology in order to drive innovation. Since 2021, Alan has combined his extensive
knowledge of how the metallurgical grade silicon industry is integrated with the polysilicon industry to trace the flow
of silicon materials produced with forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in the global solar and
silicone industries.
